These post-its were taped onto the chart binder and would always fall off the charts. I was frustrated and thought that there must be a better way to track and report this administrative information. I taught myself MS Excel to organize my patient\u2019s data and be able to track patient visits, provider information, immunizations, and other details to speed up administrative work and reporting to give me more time for the more important task, which is direct patient care. Later, my spreadsheets were being imported by the IT Department into the financial system (clinical systems were still not implemented at that time) to speed up billing."),i.a.createElement("p",null,"My real Nursing Informatics career started in the late 1990s when I participated in my organization\u2019s electronic medical record (EMR) implementation and working with the IT Department in developing software solutions to improve tracking and reporting patient care outcomes in various quality measures.
